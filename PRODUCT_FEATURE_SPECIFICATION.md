## 6. Technical Architecture Details

### 6.1 Backend Services
- **API Gateway**: The Rust backend acts as a central API gateway, routing requests to the appropriate microservices. It provides a single entry point for the frontend, simplifying the client-side code and centralizing concerns like authentication and logging.
  - `/api/*`: Routes to the core Rust backend services.
  - `/auth/*`: Proxies requests to the Node.js authentication service.
  - `/ai/*`: Proxies requests to the Python AI service.
- **Microservices**: Modular service architecture for scalability
- **Message Queue**: Asynchronous processing with Redis/RabbitMQ
- **Caching Layer**: Multi-level caching for performance optimization
- **Database Sharding**: Horizontal scaling for large datasets

### 6.2 Security & Privacy
- **Data Encryption**: AES-256 encryption for sensitive data
- **API Security**: Rate limiting, authentication, and authorization

- **Secure Communications**: TLS 1.3 for all data transmission
- **Regular Security Audits**: Quarterly penetration testing

### 6.3 Configuration Management
For local development, the project uses a `.env` file in the root directory. For production environments, it is strongly recommended to use a dedicated secret management service to securely store and manage credentials. This approach enhances security by avoiding the need to store secrets in version control or on the filesystem.

**Recommended Secret Management Services:**
-   **AWS Secrets Manager**
-   **Google Secret Manager**
-   **HashiCorp Vault**

### 6.4 Performance & Scalability
