## Style Guidelines:

- **Primary color**: A vibrant blue (#2E9AFE), evoking trust and savings. This will be the dominant color for key actions and elements.
- **Background color**: A very light, desaturated blue (#F0F8FF), provides a clean and non-intrusive backdrop, making information easily digestible.
- **Accent color**: A contrasting yellow (#FFC857), highlights special deals and important notifications. This creates visual interest without being distracting.
- **Body and headline font**: 'Inter', a sans-serif (grotesque) typeface to promote clear UI readability.
- **Code font**: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets (for debugging, if needed).
- **Icons**: Simple, clear icons from a consistent set (e.g., Font Awesome or Material Design Icons) to represent different features and categories.
- **Layout**: Use a clean and modern layout with a focus on information hierarchy. Employ a grid system to maintain consistency across all views.
- **Animations**: Subtle animations and transitions to enhance user experience, such as price updates and coupon application confirmations. Avoid excessive or distracting animations.
