# Extension Icons

Since we can't generate actual PNG files, you'll need to create these icons:

- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels) 
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can use any icon creation tool or download DealPal logo icons and place them here.

For now, the extension will work without icons, but you'll see broken icon placeholders in Chrome.

## Quick Solution:
1. Create simple colored squares as PNG files with the above names
2. Or use any existing 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG files as placeholders
3. Place them in this `/images` folder
