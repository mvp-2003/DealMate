Icon Placeholder Guide for DealMate Extension
==============================================

To add proper icons to your DealMate browser extension, create the following files:

1. icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
   - Small icon for browser toolbar
   - Simple, recognizable design
   - High contrast colors

2. icon48.png (48x48 pixels)  
   - Medium icon for extension management page
   - Can include more detail than 16px version
   - Clear brand representation

3. icon128.png (128x128 pixels)
   - Large icon for Chrome Web Store
   - Full detail, professional appearance
   - Brand colors: Purple gradient (#8b5cf6 to #3b82f6)

Icon Design Suggestions:
- Use DealMate's purple-blue gradient theme
- Include a shopping/deal symbol (ðŸ’Ž, ðŸŽ¯, ðŸ’°)
- Keep design minimal and clean
- Ensure good visibility on light/dark backgrounds

Quick Solution:
You can temporarily use any PNG files renamed to these names, or create simple colored squares as placeholders until proper icons are designed.

Place all icon files in: /browser-extension/images/
