## Card Templates Endpoint Fix (2025-01-21)

### Issue
- Frontend was getting 'Failed to fetch card templates' error
- The /api/cards/templates endpoint was under protected routes requiring authentication
- But the endpoint itself doesn't need authentication (no AuthUser parameter)

### Solution
1. Created separate public_routes() function in card_vault.rs for non-authenticated endpoints
2. Moved /api/cards/templates to public routes
3. Added card_vault::public_routes() to the main app router without auth middleware

### Result
- Card templates endpoint now accessible at GET /api/cards/templates without authentication
- Returns 3 predefined templates: HDFC Infinia, Axis Magnus, SBI Cashback
