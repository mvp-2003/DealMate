## Recent Project Analysis

### Codebase Structure Assessment
Based on file exploration, the project has a well-organized structure:

**Frontend (Next.js)**:
- Modern React 18.3.1 with Next.js 15.3.3
- TypeScript with comprehensive type safety
- Tailwind CSS + Radix UI + ShadCN components
- Google Genkit integration for AI features
- Auth0 integration for authentication
- Comprehensive action handlers for deal operations

**Backend (Rust)**:
- Axum framework with modular route structure
- SQLx for type-safe database operations
- PostgreSQL with migration system
- JWT authentication with Auth0 integration
- Core business logic modules: analyzer, stacksmart, pricer
- Comprehensive model definitions for all entities

**Browser Extension**:
- Manifest V3 compliant
- Modular JavaScript architecture
- AI integration capabilities
- Cross-browser compatibility

**AI Service (Python)**:
- FastAPI framework
- Google Gemini integration
- Product detection and analysis
- Sentiment analysis and price prediction

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Technology Choices Rationale
1. **Rust for Backend**: Chosen for performance, memory safety, and excellent async support
2. **Python for AI**: Leverages rich ML ecosystem and Google Gemini integration
3. **Next.js for Frontend**: Modern React framework with excellent developer experience
4. **PostgreSQL**: ACID compliance, JSON support, and excellent Rust integration via SQLx
5. **Auth0**: Managed authentication service reducing security complexity

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Microservices Pattern**: Clear separation between core API and AI services
2. **API Gateway**: Rust backend serves as central routing and authentication point
3. **Type Safety**: End-to-end type safety from database to frontend
4. **Async-First**: All services designed with async/await patterns
5. **Modular Design**: Clear separation of concerns across all components

### Current Development Patterns

#### Code Organization
- **Modular Structure**: Each service has clear internal organization
- **Shared Types**: Common type definitions in shared/ directory
- **Environment Management**: Centralized .env configuration
- **Script Automation**: Comprehensive development scripts in scripts/ directory

#### Database Strategy
- **Migration-Based**: SQLx migrations for schema version control
- **Type-Safe Queries**: Compile-time SQL validation
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database resource management
- **Model-Driven**: Rust structs directly mapped to database tables

#### Security Implementation
- **JWT Authentication**: Stateless token-based auth with Auth0
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive request validation
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin resource sharing
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Development Workflow
1. **Script-Based Development**: Use scripts/ directory for common operations
2. **Environment-First**: All configuration through environment variables
3. **Type-Safe Development**: Leverage TypeScript and Rust type systems
4. **Modular Components**: Reusable components across frontend
5. **API-First Design**: Backend APIs designed before frontend implementation

### Code Quality Standards
1. **Documentation**: Comprehensive code comments and API documentation
2. **Error Handling**: Centralized error types and consistent responses
3. **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, and API testing
4. **Performance Focus**: Sub-200ms API response targets
5. **Security-First**: Authentication and authorization on all endpoints

### AI Integration Approach
1. **Microservice Pattern**: Separate Python service for AI operations
2. **Async Processing**: Non-blocking AI operations
3. **Caching Strategy**: Redis caching for expensive AI operations
4. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when AI unavailable
5. **Cost Optimization**: Efficient use of Google Gemini API
