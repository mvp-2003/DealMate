# Active Context: Feature Development

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Focus: Building Core Features

The foundational documentation and initial project structure are complete. The project has now moved into the active development phase, focusing on implementing core features.

The immediate priority is to build out the **User Settings** functionality. This is a critical feature that will allow users to manage their preferences and is a prerequisite for personalization features.

## âœ… Recent Changes

-   **Completed User Management:**
    -   Implemented full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for users in the backend.
    -   Established the API patterns for routing, database interaction, and error handling.
-   **Documentation Alignment:**
    -   Updated all memory bank files to reflect the project's current state, ensuring a reliable source of truth.

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

The plan for implementing the User Settings feature is as follows:

1.  **Backend:**
    -   Create a `settings` table in the database with a new migration file.
    -   Define the `Settings` model in `backend/src/models/settings.rs`.
    -   Create a new `backend/src/routes/settings.rs` module with GET and PUT endpoints for managing user settings.
    -   Integrate the new settings routes into the main Axum router.
2.  **Frontend:**
    -   Create a `SettingsForm.tsx` component in the frontend to allow users to view and update their settings.
    -   Develop the UI for the settings page at `/settings`.
    -   Connect the frontend component to the backend API to fetch and save settings.
