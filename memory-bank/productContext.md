# Product Context: DealPal

## ðŸŽ¯ The Problem: The Fragmented & Confusing World of Online Deals

For the average online shopper, finding the best deal is a frustrating and time-consuming process. Savings are scattered across multiple sources:
-   Store-specific discounts
-   Elusive coupon codes
-   Complex bank and credit card offers
-   Opaque reward point systems
-   Fluctuating prices across different platforms

Users are forced to manually juggle dozens of tabs, compare cryptic offer terms, and perform complex calculations to figure out the *actual* best deal. This often leads to "analysis paralysis," abandoned carts, or the nagging feeling that a better deal was missed. Existing tools are often limited to just applying coupons and lack the intelligence to optimize for total value.

## âœ… The Solution: A Smart Purchase Optimization Co-pilot

DealPal is not just another coupon aggregator. It is a **smart purchase optimization co-pilot** that empowers users to **maximize real-world savings** on every purchase with minimal effort.

Our core mission is to provide a single, trustworthy platform that intelligently navigates the complex deal landscape for the user. We achieve this by:
1.  **Aggregating Everything:** Bringing together public offers, user-submitted coupons, and bank/card-based discounts into one place.
2.  **Optimizing Combinations:** Using the **StackSmart Engine** to find the best *stack* of offers (e.g., a 20% off coupon + a 10% HDFC card discount + 5% cashback).
3.  **Ranking by Value:** Moving beyond simple discounts to rank deals based on their **true net savings and personalized value**. This includes factoring in shipping, taxes, and the monetary value of reward points.
4.  **Providing Clarity & Control:** Presenting complex information in a simple, actionable format, while always leaving the user in control of the final decision.
